# Setup

We will use Jupyter Notebooks for all exercises. There are several ways to set up a Jupyter environment for running the exercises:

## Option 1. CSC’s Notebooks

*The default option.* CSC’s Notebooks (https://notebooks.csc.fi) provides easy-to-use environments for working with data and programming. You can access everything via your web browser and CSC cloud environment computes on the background.

* Point your browser to https://notebooks.csc.fi
* Login using Haka or a CSC account (or using Alternate login and a separate username and password) 
* Find *Course Practical Machine Learning: GPU Edition* and click “Launch new”
* Wait until the “Open in browser” link appears, then click on it
* The JupyterLab notebook dashboard should appear
* If you are not familiar with Jupyter, take a moment to get to know the interface
    * open a new notebook using the Launcher (click on *Notebook: Python 3*) 
    * write some Python code to a Jupyter *cell*
    * execute the cell with *shift-enter*
* Exercises: Navigate to `intro-to-ml-gpu/day1` where all the exercise notebooks are located
    
## Option 2. Running Jupyter on your laptop

If you have a laptop that has Jupyter, Scikit-learn, and all the other necessary Python packages installed, it is possible to use it. Clone the Git repositories used on this course

    git clone https://github.com/csc-training/intro-to-ml-gpu
    
and launch Jupyter.

## Option 3. Google Colaboratory

Google has a free Jupyter Notebooks service you may want to try out. A Google account is needed to use Colaboratory.

1. Go to https://colab.research.google.com
2. If needed, sign in to your Google account using the "Sign in" button in the top-right corner
3. Select File -> Open notebook... from the menu
4. Select the GitHub tab
5. Enter the following GitHub URL: https://github.com/csc-training/intro-to-ml-gpu
6. Choose an exercise from the list of exercises
